        <h2>Locomotion of the lunar exploration rover</h2>
        Robots have become an essential part of space exploration. But wheeled mobile robots are risky to move through soft soil covered with regolith sand. 
        My research goal is to experimentally measure wheel performance to contribute to wheel design and driving control of a lunar exploration rover.

        <h2>High-speed mobility for future space exploration</h2>
        Most current space exploration rovers travel at low speeds for mission safety, especially in terms of driving stability. 
        In future exploration, it is important to overcome this problem and perform at high speed in order to expand the exploration area. 
        My research goal is to clarify the wheel characteristics at high speed traveling on soft ground and to propose an effective rover design.
